# Landslide-Prediction-Algorithm
Source code for the machine learning aspect my project which involved using EXT Classifier and GIS to predict landslide susceptibility of the area.
Note that this code wont work on other devices unless the input values X1, X2,...,X10 contain the correct file path. 
In this case I have rename the file path as "file path for feature_name"
Also I have split the dataset according to the number of data points. This may vary according to the number of data points in each csv file.
